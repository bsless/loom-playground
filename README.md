# loom-playground

This isn't a library, yet.

Before we can use Project Loom, we need to understand how. Thought I
might as well share my experiments.

## Running With Loom

You'll need some way to point Leiningen to a compatible java executable.

One option is creating a wrapper script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
JAVA_CMD="$HOME/.local/openjdk-16-loom/bin/java" lein "$@"
```

If you use GNU Emacs, you can then set dir-locals to use it:

```elisp
((clojure-mode . ((cider-lein-command . "lein16-loom"))))
```

## Status

Experimental

## Linting

Help clj-kondo help you:

```clojure
{:lint-as {loom-playground.core/with-scope clojure.core/let
           loom-playground.core/in-scope clojure.core/let}}
```
